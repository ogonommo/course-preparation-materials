- Data Types and Variables
- Conditional Statements
- Loops
- Arrays

The course also includes tasks for practicing said concepts, as well as two mock exams, similar to the entry exams for the JavaScript Alpha Program.

## javascript.info

[javascript.info](https://javascript.info/) is a great source for introducing students to the basics of the JavaScript Language. Be careful some of the resources are not listed in the best order for new learners, so you might need to check the out in the following order

Recommended:

- [JavaScript Fundamentals](https://javascript.info/first-steps) (excluding the materials on functions)
- [Data Types](https://javascript.info/data-types): only the first five subchapters on method of primitives, numbers, string, arrays, array methods
- [Code Quality](https://javascript.info/code-quality) - although this is not about language syntax but how to write better code this is a **must** if you have troubles reading your code and figure out what is what

Optional (if you feel comfortable with the core concepts studing in the JavaScript Preparation Course):

- Functions (found in [JavaScript Fundamentals](https://javascript.info/first-steps))
- [Objects](https://javascript.info/object-basics)

## [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) (advanced)

*You Don't Know JS* (the title speaks volumes) is a great resourse to delve deeper in JavaScript. There are two versions of this book, the second edition is reflecting the massive changes to the language made in ES6 (2015). Make sure to check the [Scope and Closures](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/2nd-ed/scope-closures/README.md) chapter.

## freeCodeCamp

A great collection of smaller tasks: [Basic JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-data-structures)

<br>

## [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)

Leetcode is a great resourse for testing and building on your practical knowledge on the core JS language, problem solving, and learn some Data Structures and Algorithms concepts.

You will find different problems are tagged properly, and you can find the full list [here](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/). You can also select specific subset of problems, i.e. [array tasks](https://leetcode.com/tag/array/). Start with *arrays*, *strings*, and *math*. Prefer **easy** tasks, choose **medium** only if you cannot live without pain.

## HackerRank

[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) is another great resource for practicing problem solving, although directed to more experienced users and programmers looking for a job or just a good challenge.
